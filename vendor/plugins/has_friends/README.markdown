has_friends
===========

**ATTENTION:** This is a new simpler implementation. If you want to use the previous version,
get the 1.0 tag.

Instalation
-----------

Install the plugin with

	script/plugin install git://github.com/fnando/has_friends.git

Then generate a migration with `script/generate migration create_friendships` and add the following code:

	class CreateFriendships < ActiveRecord::Migration
	  def self.up
	    create_table :friendships do |t|
	      t.references :user, :friend
	      t.datetime :requested_at, :accepted_at, :null => true, :default => nil
	      t.string :status
	    end

	    add_index :friendships, :user_id
	    add_index :friendships, :friend_id
	    add_index :friendships, :status
	  end

	  def self.down
	    drop_table :friendships
	  end
	end

Finally, run the migrations with `rake db:migrate`

Usage
-----

Add the method call `has_friends` to your model.

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	  has_friends
	end

	john = User.find_by_login 'john'
	mary = User.find_by_login 'mary'
	paul = User.find_by_login 'paul'

	# john wants to be friend with mary
	# always return a friendship object
	john.be_friends_with(mary)

	# are they friends?
	john.friends?(mary)

	# get the friendship object
	john.friendship_for(mary)

	# mary accepts john's request if it exists;
	# makes a friendship request otherwise.
	mary.be_friends_with(john)

	# check if paul is mary's friend
	mary.friends?(paul)

	# check if an user is the current user, so it can
	# be differently presented
	mary.friends.each {|friend| friend.is?(current_user) }

	# if you're dealing with a friendship object,
	# the following methods are available
	friendship.accept!

	# if you're using has_paginate plugin, you can use it:
	mary.friends.paginate(:page => 3, :limit => 10)

	# the be_friends_with method returns 2 params: friendship object and status.
	# the friendship object will be present only when the friendship is created
	# (that is, when is requested for the first time)
	# STATUS_ALREADY_FRIENDS		 # => users are already friends
	# STATUS_ALREADY_REQUESTED		 # => user has already requested friendship
	# STATUS_IS_YOU					 # => user is trying add himself as friend
	# STATUS_FRIEND_IS_REQUIRED      # => friend argument is missing
	# STATUS_FRIENDSHIP_ACCEPTED     # => friendship has been accepted
	# STATUS_REQUESTED				 # => friendship has been requested

	friendship, status = mary.be_friends_with(john)

	if status == Friends::STATUS_REQUESTED
	  # the friendship has been requested
	  Mailer.deliver_friendship_request(friendship)
	elsif status == Friends::STATUS_ALREADY_FRIENDS
	  # they're already friends
	else
	  # ...
	end

NOTE: You should have a User model. You should also have a `friends_count` column
on your model. Otherwise, this won't work! Create a new migration with `script/generate migration add_friends_count_to_user`:

	class AddFriendsCountToUser < ActiveRecord::Migration
	  def self.up
	    add_column :users, :friends_count, :integer, :default => 0, :null => false
	  end

	  def self.down
	    remove_column :users, :friends_count
	  end
	end
